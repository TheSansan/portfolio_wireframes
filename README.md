portfolio_wireframes
====================


These wireframes are for my first portfolio site. 
I will have "About Me", "My Work","For fun" and "My Blog" pages on the site. 

On the "About Me" page I will introduce myself to let people get to know me.

On the "My Work" page I will post all the work I've done so far, to show people what I've learned during the past 2 months and what I can do.

On the "For Fun" page I will post some stuff that I do for fun, like paintings, sketches, some excersies that I do when I have time.

On the "My Blog" page I will write my thoughts about web design, art, paitings, clothing, movies, anything that gives me ideas, makes me think, and makes me happy.

This site will be a window between me and the world. It will be a great way for me to express myself.
